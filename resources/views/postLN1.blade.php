	<p class="lead text-justify" style="text-indent: 40px">The Philippines on Thursday, April 7, logged 6,414 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country's total to 819,164.
    "The relatively lower number of cases today is due to the low number of samples received by laboratories last April 4, 2021," the Department of Health (DOH) said.
    Of the total cases, 19.4% or 158,701 are active or currently sick.</p><br>

	<p class="lead text-justify" style="text-indent: 40px">The DOH also reported2 242 new deaths due to COVID-19, bringing the death toll to 14,059. The number includes the 133 cases which were previously tagged as recoveries and were reclassified as deaths after final validation.</p>

    <p class="lead text-justify" style="text-indent: 40px">Meanwhile, recoveries are up by 163, raising the total to 646,404. The DOH also reported a positivity rate of 18.2% out of 37,329 tests in its bulletin. These positive cases are added to the tally of confirmed cases only after further validation. 
    The department explained that the process helps ensure that cases would not be recorded in duplicates, and that all test results had been submitted.</p>
    
    <p class="lead text-justify" style="text-indent: 40px">The DOH said 5 laboratories were not able to submit their data on time. A Monday report said that it was looking to set up a "triage system" across local government units to manage the flow of patients needing health care. 
    In recent days, relatives of COVID-19 patients have been turning to social media for help with finding available hospitals for admission, with some of them narrating how their loved ones died without proper treatment due as there was no space left in hospitals.</p><br><br><br>
